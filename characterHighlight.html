                    <p>Hello folks, this week on Character Highlight we have none other than a damn Redcoat: Charles Dickens. I'm just kidding for our readers abroad, we’re all friends now. Anywho, he was born in England and has now become a critically acclaimed novelist, journalist, editor and illustrator. My personal favorite work of his is Oliver Twist, but my Co-Writer Nathan swears by David Copperfield. This man has managed to publish 12 works so far, with rumors coming that he’ll manage to publish 3 more before he finally kicks the bucket. But yet again, what do I know? It’s not like I can predict the future or anything. Quite interestingly enough, Dickens serves to focus on the gloomy life of factory workers. Now which of our readers can relate to that? Horrible working conditions, child labor, little pay. Not like we have any of that here in the land of the free.</p>
	<p>A self-made man, who clawed his way through the factories at a young age, Dickens is sure to be admired. But let us not forget our proud American Authors here who do so much to advance literacy across the country.</p>

                        <p>Lads and ladettes, today is a very special day on Character Highlight. We will be interviewing a woman. Never been done here before, but as my wife tells me every night, there's a first time for everything, right? Below is the transcript of our interview:</p>
                        <p>Fratian: How does it feel to be the first woman on Character Highlight?</p>
                        <p>Pankhurst: Quite disappointing really.</p>
                        <p>Fratian: Oh, why is that?</p>
                        <p>Pankhurst: Because there were plenty of woman before me who deserve the same recognition as these men that come here.</p>
                        <p>Fratian: Alrighty, I can see your point. Now can you tell the folks at home just what makes you so special. What have you accomplished that landed you here?</p>
                        <img class="ui medium floated right image" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/25/Emmeline_Pankhurst%2C_seated_%281913%29.jpg/220px-Emmeline_Pankhurst%2C_seated_%281913%29.jpg"/>
                        <p>Pankhurst: I simply put into actions the words of woman. We needed a voice, and I acted as the beacon.</p>
                        <p>Fratian: Now, I’d like to ask you a little bit about your controversies. Do you regret protesting the U.S. government during WW1?</p>
                        <p>Pankhurst: Absolutely not! If I had not, and knowing the men in charge, we still wouldn’t have the right to vote!</p>
                        <p>Fratian: Ok, now what can you tell our readers about the WSPU?</p>
                        <p>Pankhurst: Well, the WSPU, or Women’s Social and Political Union is a women only movement dedicated to attaining suffrage back in England. A wonderful union.</p>
                        <p>Fratian: Err, well if you say so. Now what about in America?</p>
                        <p>Pankhurst: Well I visited a little bit in 1916 and after the Armistice, and I guess that I influenced the movement here in America. After all, you now have suffrage for all right?</p>
                        <p>Fratian: Yeah, effective 1920. Thank you for coming in today Pankhurst.</p>
                        <p>Pankhurst: My pleasure.</p>

                               <p> My favorite man. He’s all I hear about down at the bar. He’ll put an end to the bane of capitalism with a better ‘c’ word - communism. No longer shall we suffer from unequal treatment across society. Sharing is caring-literally. I hope you remember what you learned in grade school, if Marx is right, it’s about to become mainstream. This man is educated, he sees the future. He attended the University of Bonn and then moved on towards the more serious University of Berlin after partaking in Bonn’s party scene. Regardless of all that, this man co-wrote The Communist Manifesto that talks all about his genius new way of thinking. A political theory that he derived that advocates for a class war and leading to a society in which all property is public (no one person owns private property). Each person works and is paid according their abilities (meritocracy) and needs (socialism). A fantastic idea, now let's just see if it actually works in reality.</p>
