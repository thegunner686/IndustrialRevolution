                    <p>The Industrial Revolution was an event that changed and shaped world history. It is the tangible manifestation of the slow awakening from the Dark and Middle Ages. There are many bookmarks like this in world history, but the Industrial Revolution establishes itself as something perhaps more significant, more pertinent, and more necessary than any other. It is the culmination of the Renaissance, Reformation, Age of Exploration, and Enlightenment - the destination to which those events seemed to steer the ship of world politics, society, and economics towards. And succeeding events: nation-building, the two World Wars, and the Cold War, are all best described as the world trying to adjust to the new modern industrial age that it found itself in.</p>
                    <p>So that’s WHAT the Industrial Revolution is. But HOW did it come to pass? WHY was it so significant? WHERE did it start? WHEN did it start? WHO were the major players in this revolution? In this edition, we feature three scholastic pieces on the exciting new scientific innovations, written brilliantly by George Fratian in a way to grab your child’s attention and get them excited about science - find them in the News - Science section. George Fratian also has a special edition of his Character Highlight series in this edition, again explaining some of the major players of the Industrial Revolution in the best way he knows for your elementary level readers. In the adult section, Nathan Wang has written three full length pieces for your own digestion, on the larger issues surrounding the Industrial Revolution to give you a glance into the minutia of what the Industrial Revolution was - find them in the News - Social section. And last but not least, for those blessed with a history quirk, there is a convenient timeline of innovations and inventions that will spark your interest and guide your reading.</p>
                    <p>Are you excited? We are.</p>
                
                From the editors and creators,
                N. Wang, G. Spencer, and G. Fratian
