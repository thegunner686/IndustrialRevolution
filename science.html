                    <p>The Steam engine is the new invention of the century. But how does it work? Well for starters you need a fuel source. Let's look towards the coal mines for help, and gather some coal. Now that we've gotten our fuel, let's start building our steam engine. The fuel (coal) burns producing heat that causes water to turn into steam (hence the name of the engine) in a boiler (where the water sits). Then, that steam is captured and used to power the machine. Then, a cylinder and a piston is used to make the machine work (as steam enters the cylinder causing the piston to push out via pressure). Then, a machine is attached to the piston causing it to make something move. As the piston pushes outwards and repeats to cause movement. That ladies and gentlemen is how your train that takes you to work in the factories works, just as the machines in the textile industry functions.</p>

                        <h5 class="ui header">Geo Fratian, Editor, Published 2/26/2019</h5>
                       <p> Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls the future has arrived. No longer shall we be confined to the realm of iron, but rather pass through that age and enter the steel one. We shall become men of steel (foreshadowing). We shall rebuild our transportation. We shall rebuild our cities. And we shall forge stronger and more modern buildings than have ever been made before. Steel can support so much more than iron. We can build towards the sky! Envision a future with me, as steel revolutionizes our world. Honestly, I think we all need to give a little shout out to my man Henry Bessemer for his ingenious Bessemer process that allowed all of this to happen. Our weapons will be stronger than ever before. Our buildings will stand taller than ever before. Our production will greatly increase! Steel has the power to build stronger machines, ones that can be used to harvest food at a much faster rate than before. Unfortunately, as of right now, Steel can still rust, am problem we all know too well. That gear stop working because it got wet - blame rust. That knife can’t cut meat anymore - maybe blame rust. Your gun can’t shoot straight - blame rust. That being said, I believe that one day mankind will solve this riddle, who knows maybe they’ll call it ‘Stainless Steel’ after a man named Stanley or something.</p>

                            <h5 class="ui header">Geo Fratian, Editor, Published 2/26/2019</h5>
                            <p>What is this newfangled energy source that old Benjamin Franklin keeps on yakking about? A form of energy resulting from charged particles? Utterly ridiculous. Old Ben seems to think that we can harness the power of lighting by putting a metal pole on the roof of our houses. Does he intend to kill us all? </p>
                           <p> As if old Ben wasn’t enough. Now we have some psycho named Thomas Edison and his lapdog who actually does the work Nikolai Tesla. They claim to be able to power lights with electricity. To harness lightning? Hey genius lightning already makes light. </p>
                            <p>Another man named Michael Faraday invented some invention called Direct Current (DC) that can bring electricity directly to you! How great, if you want to bring yourself to an early grave. But lo and behold, fear not stranger. For Nikolai Tesla is back at it again to challenge Faraday with Alternating Current (AC). Now you can alternate which place you want to electrify first. Thanks Tesla. Why don’t we name magnetic flux density after you? Just kidding, we don’t even know what that is yet. </p>
                            <p>So there you have it folks, when your whole city blows up from harnessing lightning, you can thank these men: Franklin, Edison, Tesla, and Faraday. See ya in the next issue!</p>
