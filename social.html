                <h1 class="ui header">On The Precipice: A Revolution</h1>
                <h5>Nathan Wang, Editor, Published 2/26/2019</h5>
                <p>We all remember the days of the cottage industry. The days when Mom’s dresses and your best Sunday clothes came from Auntie’s own needle and hours of hard work. For those who don’t remember, clothes used to be produced in a tedious, laborious manner that started in a fuzzy little animal called the sheep.</p>
                <!-- <img class="ui medium floated left image" style="width: 300px;height:300px;opacity:0"/> -->
                <canvas class="ui floated left image" id="fourier"></canvas>
                <p>Sheep were locally raised, locally sheared, and their wool locally turned into woolens. Those woolens would be bought/traded for in the local markets to housewives. From there, a process of using spinning wheels would allow the rough, uneven material to be transformed into a workable yarn. Now yarn would then continue to be woven on looms using pure human labor, aided somewhat by simple mechanical physics. This process took place in weaver’s cottages, where weaver’s worked tirelessly to produce woolens or calico. These refined products were transported using packmules or river and canal systems all around Britain, where all types of textiles then could be manufactured through the needle and a lot of skill. This is historically a slow process, but it’s the way it’s been done for hundreds of years, and in fact, has been improving over the centuries.</p>
	            <p>However, new advancements seem to be changing the way we do things… in a DRASTIC way. Reports are coming in that a new raw material is on the rise, and its name is cotton. Cotton traditionally was an Indian product, one of the keystone ingredients to their economy, but ever since our mercantilist philosophies drove us around the world, cotton has gone global. It’s a cheaper, lighter, and more durable material than wool or linen, and is outcompeting many of the traditional products in our markets. Further on the raw material front, the phenomenon now named the Agricultural Revolution has allowed for exponentially greater production of materials.</p>
                <img class="ui medium floated right image" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.intriguing-history.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/spinning-mule-Google-Search.png"/>
                <p>But with this surplus of materials comes an increased need for quicker, more efficient ways of processing that material. And that need for efficiency and innovation is a fertile ground for the genius of the human mind. Enter in John Kay’s flying shuttle, Richard Arkwright’s water frame, the spinning Jenny, and Samuel Crompton’s spinning mule. These inventions filled the vacuum of innovation within the production of the textile industry. The vacuum then shifted to the next phase of the industry: transportation and energy. From there, we begin to see an impending stampede of industrial revolution.</p>
                <p>The revamping of the textile industry is more than a change in how people produce clothes and curtains and carpets, it’s a change in the very philosophy and reality of our economic state. From industry to industry, a complex domino effect of supply, demand, competition, and resource scarcity is set to boom our old age of slow, inefficient living, into the stratosphere of a new modern era.</p>

                <h1 class="ui header">Push And Pull, A Story On Migration</h1>
                <h5>Nathan Wang, Editor, Published 2/26/2019</h5>
                <p>The Agricultural Revolution can best be understood as the precursor and enabler of the Industrial Revolution; the Plato to its Aristotle, and Soulja to its Drake. It allowed for food surplus, the most accurate and surefire indicator of progression in a civilization. Food surplus is at the very least correlated to, if not a direct causation of, population growth and general wealth. More people meant a larger workforce, which meant a more diverse and specialized economy, which meant the evolution of industry. And coupled with the various labor and innovative needs that the Agricultural Revolution, and later all industries, required, and the world-changing event known as the Industrial Revolution becomes not only possible, but probable. Thus, the study of the Agricultural Revolution, at least a study of the most important aspects of it, is the study of demographics, how it shifts, grows, and changes.</p>
                <img class="ui medium floated left image" src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRwuEeWVopriAWN-2P7ZwHwL5IbvrqLnTI_dfvEOgRQ5OBhkD0o"/>
                <p>But there is always a basis, a catalyst, for change. For the Agricultural Revolution, that catalyst would be the scientific improvements in farming philosophy. There were two major pushes in this direction that are worth mentioning. To begin with, the concept of crop rotation increased crop and livestock yields significantly while at the same time allowing farmers to produce foodstuffs in the same area of land. Transitioning from slash and burn agriculture to crop rotation made land as a resource much more plentiful and high-yielding. The second would be the seed drill. Jethro Tull commonly has his name tied to this innovation, and it is truly a huge catalyst in the efficiency part of agriculture. It greatly increases the effectiveness of, while also decreasing effort and time spent on, planting, nurturing, and harvesting. These two catalysts together drew enough attention to the potential of the British agricultural system that real change could occur.</p>
                <p>On deck and ready to make a statement is the process of enclosure. On a large scale what it was was a shift from a feudalistic Quesnay philosophy of landowning to the Smithian world of capital. On a more individual level enclosure was the forcing out of peasant class farmers from their subsistence lands where all they could do was feed their family and maybe trade goods once in a while, displacing them from agricultural lands. What replaced them were wealthier, usually government sponsored or government friendly agricultural systems that were much more efficient and much more productive. From here, the fuel that would spark the Industrial Revolution grew plentiful.</p>

                <p>But those it displaced were moved to the cities, and a mass urbanization would take place. Compared to the process of collectivization in Soviet Russia, these peasant class migrants had it unbearably easy. But from any other standard, it was a rough transition. Skilled farmers became unskilled laborers, punching in hours day after day in a cold and unfeeling city. It required the hardest of wills to be able to survive in the grueling toddlers of modern cities. But at the same time, families were easier fed, job opportunities were plentiful, and with the population spike came a massive increase in labor and innovation, set to seep into the branches of infrastructure, transportation, technology, and further industry, setting in action a neverending cogwheel of progress and improvement that is and forever will be a testament to the capabilities of the human race.</p>

                    <h1 class="ui header">Victory in Britain: Labor Rights Expand</h1>
                    <h5>Nathan Wang, Editor, Published 2/26/2019</h5>
                    <img class="ui medium floated left image" src="http://history.parkfieldprimary.com/_/rsrc/1313410827504/victorians/victorian-coal-mines/mines3.gif?height=152&width=400"/>
                    <p> Few have seen the ugly side of the Industrial Revolution, but even fewer knew how to fix it. Perhaps the most jarring stain on the progression of modern society is the image of barely conscientious toddlers, so commonly portrayed innocently in the embrace of a mother or in the comfort of a warm and safe home, sludging through harsh, dirty, dangerous work environments and individual laborers, bearing the cross on which the old archaic age died. It is no surprise that the first actions of the slowly awakening labor movement was to abolish this monstrosity that haunted the progress and truly remarkable achievements of the Industrial Revolution.</p>
                    <img class="ui medium floated right image" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.timetoast.com/public/uploads/photos/9161570/re.jpg?1479038093"/>
                    <p>The legislative journey to where we stand today was a long road.. It follows a series of UK labor law Acts passed by Parliament to regulate the conditions of industrial employment. The early Acts concentrated on regulating the hours of work and moral welfare of young children employed in cotton mills. The Act of 1833 put an enforcer behind the black words on white paper. From there, labor rights began flowing into other concerns that continued to plague the workforce. The regulation of working hours was extended to women by an Act of 1844. The Ten Hour Acts met a long-standing demand by the millworkers for a ten-hour day, extending rights and protections all across the board. Eventually, requirements on ventilation, sanitation, and guarding of machinery would become the third prong of the Acts as workers began to be protected. The Mines Act of 1842 would prevent children and women from working in the difficult and deadly mines.</p>
                    <img class="ui medium floated left image" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.timetoast.com/public/uploads/photos/6957930/8898186_orig.jpg?1477708900"/>
                    <p>These legislative victories, however, encompassed far more than simply labor hours and protections and age restrictions. It represents an awakening of the conscience for a new modern age. Many Acts had provisions for the education of the youth instead of the employment of the youth. Among other things, it included a better environment for child-rearing. It was the slow realization of the speeding Industrial train that perhaps unending progress and pure profit built from the deaths of those it depended on was a path to a dead end. For we do not progress for the sake of progress, but for the higher and purer collect for which it serves. These legislative victories represent the first steps to understanding what this new modern age means as it reshuffles society and the philosophies under which we operate. It is the first steps towards unraveling how we can live in this machine, growing grander and more complex every passing second, until it comes time for another revolution.</p>
